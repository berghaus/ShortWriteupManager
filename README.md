# ShortWriteupManager
The CERN Program Library is a set of scientific software tools. They adress the needs of physics laboratories and researchers. These tools are contained in a set of libraries and modules. The code is written in FORTRAN. Contemporary projects such as SciPy provide some if CERNLIB's functionality.

The CERN Program Library is needed by past and present physics experiments. These 320 short write-ups document the routines provided by the libraries. The modules which address more complex needs are documented in a set of long write-ups which will be managed elsewhere.

Development of the CERN Program Library finished in the 1990's. Official support ceased in the 2000's. The goal of this project is to create a catalogue of the documentation. Then to archive that catalogue in tex, HTML, and PDF/A format using the CERN Document Server. This code is an adaption of https://github.com/aydevosotros/DataPreservationCERNProject
